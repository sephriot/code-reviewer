title: Four review actions with different handling paths
type: note
confidence: high
summary: 'ReviewAction enum defines four outcomes, each with distinct handling: (1) approve_without_comment → auto-posted to GitHub, recorded in pr_reviews immediately. (2) approve_with_comment → queued in pending_approvals, human confirms via web UI. (3) request_changes → queued in pending_approvals, human confirms via web UI. (4) requires_human_review → recorded in pr_reviews with reason, no GitHub action. Actions 2 and 3 are only recorded in pr_reviews after human approval in the web UI.'
