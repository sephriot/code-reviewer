title: 'Sound notification system: cross-platform with per-event sound files'
type: note
confidence: high
summary: 'SoundNotifier supports separate sound files for different events: general notification, PR approval, review timeout, and merged/closed PR. Each has an independent enabled flag and optional custom sound file. Platform detection uses platform.system(). macOS uses afplay, Linux tries aplay/paplay/sox, Windows uses PowerShell. Fallback chain: custom sound file → general sound file → system beep → terminal bell character. All play methods are async (subprocess-based).'
